The repository includes the core Python file, "Adventure Game.py," featuring functions for reading map data, creating rooms, and managing gameplay. The map layout is defined in the "Map.txt" file, providing a structure of the mansion, room connections, and item placements. You can change the text file to spice up your gameplay every time you play!
